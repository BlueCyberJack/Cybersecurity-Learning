### Cybersecurity Policy Foundations

This was the second course I studied, and in hindsight, it may not have been the best choice so early in my cybersecurity learning journey, especially before covering some core IT fundamentals. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the course and plan to revisit cybersecurity policy later as I progress.

One of the key takeaways was recognising how transferable my policing skills are to the cybersecurity industry, with some necessary adaptations of course. I identified strong parallels between my experience as a police officer and the following areas:
- Policies
- Standards
- Guidance
- Frameworks

For example, in cybersecurity, the NICE framework is used for incident response, but it serves only as a foundation, it must be expanded to align with an organisation's specific objectives. This mirrors my current role in managing sex offenders, where I apply the ARMS framework for conducting risk assessments. Whilst ARMS provides a structured framework, I tailor it to each individual to ensure the final assessment effectively mitigates risks and safeguards the public.

Similarly, policing has instilled in me the importance of adhering to policies and procedures when investigating crimes and maintaining professional standards when working with the public. These same principles are fundamental in cybersecurity, reinforcing my confidence in transitioning into the field.
