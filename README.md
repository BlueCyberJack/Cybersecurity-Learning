### Cybersecurity Policy Foundations

This was the second course I studied, and in hindsight, it may not have been the best choice so early in my cybersecurity learning journey, especially before covering some core IT fundamentals. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the course and plan to revisit cybersecurity policy later as I progress.

One of the key takeaways was recognising how transferable my policing skills are to the cybersecurity industry, with some necessary adaptations of course. I identified strong parallels between my experience as a police officer and the following areas:
- Policies
- Standards
- Guidance
- Frameworks

For example, in cybersecurity, the NICE framework is used for incident response, but it serves only as a foundation, it must be expanded to align with an organisation's specific objectives. This mirrors my current role in managing sex offenders, where I apply the ARMS framework for conducting risk assessments. Whilst ARMS provides a structured framework, I tailor it to each individual to ensure the final assessment effectively mitigates risks and safeguards the public.

Similarly, policing has instilled in me the importance of adhering to policies and procedures when investigating crimes and maintaining professional standards when working with the public. These same principles are fundamental in cybersecurity, reinforcing my confidence in transitioning into the field.



### Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyberattacks

The course highlighted clear parallels between cybersecurity roles and criminal investigation. Critical thinking was introduced in the first module, emphasizing key investigative skills already ingrained in policing—such as challenging assumptions to stay on the right path and using the ‘5 W’s & H’ in the information-gathering stage.

The second module explored cyberattacks, covering different types of threat actors, their motives, and current cybersecurity trends. It provided a breakdown of threats like malware and ransomware, along with another major risk being social engineering.
I found social engineering particularly interesting because, in many ways, it’s just a more technical term for common scams. Before this course, I assumed cyberattacks were always carried out by highly skilled individuals using sophisticated techniques. However, I learned that many attacks succeed not through technical expertise, but by exploiting human nature, which I know realise is the one biggest weaknesses in cybersecurity. 
One method attackers use is sending phishing emails designed to trick victims into revealing sensitive information. For example, an email posing as a bank alert might urge the recipient to reset their password due to a "compromised account". The provided link leads to a fake banking website where the victim unknowingly hands over their bank account details, allowing the attacker to access their funds.

The similarities in module 1 became even more apparent in Module 3, which covered the four phases of Incident Response (IR):

-Preparation & Planning

-Detection & Analysis

-Containment, Eradication & Recovery

-Post-Incident Activities

I found strong connections between these phases and my investigative experience in policing. The structured approach of IR closely mirrors criminal investigations, reinforcing how transferable my skill set is to cybersecurity.
The Incident Response role particularly intrigued me, and I’m eager to explore it further as I continue my learning journey.

The last learning module covered cybersecurity controls such as authorisation, authentication and the physical security controls available. It highlighted how the threat to the cybersecurity landscape is everchanging and the need for continuous development is essential to ensure that everybody; members of the public, goverment organisations & agencies, and all businesses have effective cybersecurity defences to mitigate risk. 

The final module was a project consisting of three tasks to complete. 
The first task was a scenario where I acted as an IT security analyst and reviewed the current cybersecurity infrastructure. I was able to highlight the vulnerabilities such as no access control system present, lack of physical locks in some areas of the building and key data centres lacking modern systems to implement access control, log data and serious physical security vulnerabilities. I then went on to explain authentication methods that could be implemented and explained the pros and cons of four proposed MFA options. To conclude the project I provided solutions to the identified vulnerabilities by stating what the threats are and what improvements I would make to improve cybersecurity.

Beyond the course, I pursued additional learning on vulnerability scanners. While the course briefly covered this topic, I wanted a deeper understanding, so I found Gerard O'Brien on YouTube. His content provided a practical guide on how a SOC Analyst would use these tools in daily operations.
One tool he demonstrated was Nessus, though he explained that multiple scanning tools exist, each with unique features. Gerard's videos have been extremely helpful, and his content even inspired me to create this portfolio on GitHub to document my learning journey.
